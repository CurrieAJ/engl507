## 27 January 2015: Thought Piece Review

### Bassam's Thought Piece

**Research:** a quantified comparison of Walker's illustrations in Thackeray's *The Adventure of Philip* to Thackeray's other novels and Walker's other illustrations.

**Points to Consider:**
* How unique are Walker’s illustrations? Do they humanize ethnic minorities? Are these illustrations representative of the time? Are they radical images?
* How do you intend to quantify the uniqueness of these comparisons?
* Type ideas: clothing, posture, facial expressions, settings, etc.
* Quantification ideas: context of the illustrations, ethnic individuals, clothing, social status, etc.
* Do you intned to counteract the narrative of the text?
* By comparing image and text, could you argue Walker and Thackeray’s stances on racial issues during this time period?
* How are you going to organize the images? What types do you intend to use?
* How can you limit your scope? Period? 
* Could you quantify the levels of racism within the text and/or illustrations?

It'll be very interesting to see what kinds research questions and arguments will emerge from your analyses!

### Lindsey's Thought Piece

**Research:** is Austen a representation of a social past or social future? Can class be proven to be static or modernist?

**Points to Consider:**
* Conceptualization of possible class and interpersonal relations
* Project can build on other possible research questions: narrative style, character relations, racism (if any), class stratification, etc.
* Could you make this project maliable for other projects? Could you trace the social past/future of all Austen’s novels then network each network together?
* Do the characters go beyond their social circles?
* Would you be able to focus on the protagonists specifically and secondary characters specifically? (For example: colour coding)
* Does class make you morally sound?

**Possible Readings:**
"Graph Visualization Software for Networks of Characters in Plays" by Amerlia Carolina Sparavigna and Roberto Marazzato

I think this project could become a point of reference for future Austen scholars!

### Alyssa's Thought Piece

**Research:** does Blake play into the language present in newspapers surrounding tigers/tygers? Does he challenge it?

**Points to Consider:**
* Could you argue the text as a piece on animal activism? Was there a particular intent using the language? Does it satirize or parody the language?
* What is your scope?
** 5-10 years leading up to the publication of “The Tyger”
** All London newspapers? Big news headlines?
* To what extent do each article discuss tigers? How sensationalized are the tigers in the articles?
* Could you look at tiger poems that are published in the articles in relation to Blake’s poem? What kind of language do they use?

Using Wordle will be very visually appealing (if you wanted to integrate the images into your research paper) and will help you quantify key terms! Good choice!

## 27 January 2015: Thought Piece

To challenge and highlight the effects urbanization has had on the environment, Eden Robinson's *Monkey Beach* (2000) indicates the significance of ecological insight as well as the importance of independent sustainability in rural settings; by familiarizing herself with her ecological surroundings, the protagonist forms transcendental geographical bonds as well as a sense of place through her environmental interactions. However, with the emergence of urbanization in traditionally rural areas, Robinson subtly expresses the exploitation of plant and wildlife habitats for personal and corporative gain. How, then, does Robinson's novel become an eco-critical analysis of Haisla agricultural tradition and Eurocentric ecological manipulation?

Deviating from traditional human coding, new media and computation could limit systematic and human errors, providing accurate quantifiable readings of environment-related instances within the text. In addition, utilizing a computational method may produce larger key term, formulaic sequence, and comparative ratio yields, and I believe that computation will not only apply to this research question specifically but also to the larger questions surrounding spatial awareness as historical, ecological, and cultural insight.

To produce these results, I would like to employ computer-aided text analysis to draw out these key terms and quantify their recurrence in the text. During the initial transcribing of the novel as a text file, active markdown would allow the tagging and searching of key terms specific to plants, animals, cultural sustainability, and destroyed ecosystems. By applying semantic occurrence and algorithmic equations, quantifications of particular environmental instances, related character interactions, and term context could define, for example, the interaction ratio between the Haisla, the settlers, and place.

In selecting this method, I hope quantifying the recurrence of key terms, people's interactions with place, and eco-critical implications will help me explore diverging place-based relationships between Haisla members and Eurocentric settlers.

## 20 January 2015: After Hermes?

While grappling with Galloway's heavily theoretical and mythological interpretations of mediation, I wonder why "media threaten to render us speechless" (27) and why hermeneutics, iridescence, and infuriation seemingly are compelled to combat for dominance. Galloway describes hermeneutics as "critical tradition" (40) whereas iridescence is "a [parallel] secondary world" of expression (44); in opposition to these two modes of mediation, infuriation intends to "annihilate" critical tradition altogether (40). Even though he claims a new hegemony of negotiated dominance will emerge with the withering of hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence, I am not entirely compelled or persuaded by Galloway's observations. I do, however, agree that new or adapted modes of mediation are pertinent in the development of critically understanding new media formats, technologies, and criticisms.

Regardless if Galloway is accurate in his assumptions, what effects would his claims have on a proposed readership or media-based demographic? Would the elimination of hermeneutics and iridescence deter people from critical discourse and/or thinking? Will there be a progression in literary and cultural criticism without these fundamental mediators? Will all future arguments circulate in a never-ending spiral of like-minded thought?

Perhaps, then, Galloway's analysis of a synthesized fourth middle promotes both "the exile into foreign land...[and] a return to a more somatic immediacy" (18). By incorporating various components of different communication, could we not create a new middle that does not dominate but rather coexists? With a multimodal communicative system, other modes of interpretation could emerge in the process of mediation; arguably, a new method could promote a non-linear and multi-dimensional understanding of critical interpretation.
