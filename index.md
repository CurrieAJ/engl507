## 13 January 2015: After Hermes?

While grappling with Galloway's heavily theoretical and mythological interpretations of mediation, I wonder why "media threaten to render us speechless" (27) and why hermeneutics, iridescence, and infuriation seemingly are compelled to combat for dominance. Galloway describes hermeneutics as "critical tradition" (40) whereas iridescence is "a [parallel] secondary world" of expression (44); in opposition to these two modes of mediation, infuriation intends to "annihilate" critical tradition altogether (40). Even though he claims a new hegemony of negotiated dominance will emerge with the withering of hermeneutic interpretation and immanent iridescence, I am not entirely compelled or persuaded by Galloway's observations. I do, however, agree that new or adapted modes of mediation are pertinent in the development of critically understanding new media formats, technologies, and criticisms.

Regardless if Galloway is accurate in his assumptions, what effects would his claims have on a proposed readership or media-based demographic? Would the elimination of hermeneutics and iridescence deter people from critical discourse and/or thinking? Will there be a progression in literary and cultural criticism without these fundamental mediators? Will all future arguments circulate in a never-ending spiral of like-minded thought?

Perhaps, then, Galloway's analysis of a synthesized fourth middle promotes both "the exile into foreign land...[and] a return to a more somatic immediacy" (18). By incorporating various components of different communication, could we not create a new middle that does not dominate but rather coexists? With a multimodal communicative system, other modes of interpretation could emerge in the process of mediation; arguably, a new method could promote a non-linear and multi-dimensional understanding of critical interpretation.
