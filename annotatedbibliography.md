### Bisht, Raj Kishor, Garima Srivastava, H. S. Dhami. "Term Weighting Using Term Dependence." *International Journal of Computer Applications,* 3.11 (2010): 1-3. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* Bisht et al. argue that ‘term weighting’ is an integral part of term extraction; they indicate that the ‘weight’ determines the relevance of a term to the document and, therefore, to the outcome.
* They propose a local weighting scheme for word pairs, which they argue can better describe a document and emphasize the importance of word combinations.

Relevance:
* Regardless if I use a text extraction tool or manually extract relevant terms, applying a non-logarithmic variant of ‘term weighting’ will help me determine the relevance of searching for words as culturally specific as oxasuli or as menial as tree. It could also help determine term and character relations.

#### Elson, David K., Nicholas Dames, and Kathleen R. McKeown. "Extracting Social Networks from Literary Fiction." *ACL '10.* Association for Computation Linguistics, 2009. 138-147. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* The authors create a methodology in which they can extract instances of quoted dialogue from a text, and constructing a network will expose bilateral conversations and frequency and lengths of character exchanges.
* To support their methodology, Eslon et al. analyze related works on social networking, decide methods for extracting accurate dialogue, and finally implement their methods to create the project and to prove/disprove their hypotheses.

Relevance:
* This framework could be beneficial when I decide on a particular avenue for the information I intend to find.
* Upon extracting every instance of plants within *Monkey Beach*, I could construct an ecological social network that includes plant and character interactions, medicinal or edible purposes, recipes (if applicable), etc.
* Perhaps this exploration will make readers think differently about the inclusion of specific ecology in the text.

#### Fraser, David. “A ‘Practical’ Ethic for Animals.” *Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics,* 25.5 (2012): 721-746. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* Human activities affecting animals in four ways: domestication, slaughter, unintended harm, and habitat destruction.
* The continual destruction of ecosystems negatively affecting animal relations: geographic displacement, food sources, natural patterns of behaviour.
* Offers solutions on how to prevent or mend ethical concerns.

Relevance:
* The article draws upon the ethical concerns of indirect or unintentional animal maltreatment due to human interactions.
* These concerns relate to Robinson’s portrayal of animal displacement (bears) and disappearance (oolichan).
* It contextualizes otherwise unexplained human impacts on animals.

#### Hovy, Eduard, Zornista Kozareva, and Ellen M. Riloff. "Towards Completeness in Concept Extraction and Classification." *EMNLP.* Association for Computational Linguistics, 2009. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* While an obvious contender for the algorithmic harvesting of terms, Hovy et al. believe that WordNet is deficient because “it is neither complete nor is its taxonomic structure inarguably perfect” (1). By using a single surface-level pattern, the authors construct an algorithm to extract more terms than WordNet and broaden their taxonomic categorization.

Relevance:
* As I look for methods to either extract key terms from *Monkey Beach* or a way to present my findings, determining an algorithm that will produce my expected yield is pertinent.
* After extracting the terms and contextualizing them, could I put the spreadsheet results into a WordNet-like algorithm to reveal emerging themes such as medicinal relevance, Westernized understandings, etc.

#### Johnson, Leslie Main. “Plants, Places, and the Storied Landscape: Looking at First Nations Perspectives on Plants and Land.” *BC Studies,* 179 (2013): 85-91, 93-99, 102-105, 255. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* “Plants shape landscapes and are, in turn, responsive to the characteristics of the land” (85).
* Plants as mediating our interactions with place.
* By analyzing plant habitats, naming, and ethnographic stories from elders, Johnson intends to connect people and plants through relevant narratives.

Relevance:
* Johnson builds on and adds new plant and landscape-based understandings of First Nations cultures that Robinson addresses in her novel.
* Legitimizes plants names as cultural understanding.

#### Kundoque, Jacquie Green. “Reclaiming Haisla Ways: Remembering Oolichan Fishing.” *Canadian Journal of Native Education,* 31.1 (2008): 11-23, 319. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* As an indigenous student and professor, Kundoque understands the importance of nurturing and cultivating oral tradition. She argues that Haisla narratives help discover cultural history and the relationship have with plants and animals (particularly the oolichan).

Relevance:
* She corroborates Robinson’s mentioning of the disappearance of the oolichan and further details human and interference in their habitats, spawning, and migration patterns.
* She lists the importance of oolichan to the Haisla for its sustenance, medicinal properties, and rate of exchange.

#### Park, Gyeong-Mi, Sung-Hwan Kim, Hye-Ryeon Hwang, and Hwan-Gue Cho. "Complex System Analysis of Social Networks Extracted from Literary Fictions." *International Journal of Machine Learning and Computing,* 3.1 (2013): 107-111. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* Using lexical analysis, the authors construct a method to determine textual distances and social relationships between characters in a text.
* They establish that "mining the topological structure of [a textual] social graph" will allow them to measure the extent in which protagonists or protragonists and secondary characters interact.

Relevance:
* Similar to Elson et al.'s work, Park et al. provide a social network framework that could be manipulated to refelect an 'ecological' network of Eden Robinson's flora.

#### Ryan, Courtney. “Playing with Plants.” *Theatre Journal,* 65.3 (2013): 335-353. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* Ryan develops ideas surrounding human and animal engagement by applying and implementing ecocritical analysis upon plant and people interdependency.
* She also determines that animals rely on geography for sustenance and shelter in similar ways that human rely on plants and animals.

Relevance:
* While she does not discuss what happens when geography is manipulated or destroyed, she does emphasize human, plant, and animal codependency.
* When extracting key terms of *Monkey Beach*, I could contextually analyze who interacts with particular plant/animals and how those interactions affect one’s understandings.

#### Soper-Jones, Ella. “The Fate of the Oolichan: Prospects of Eco-cultural Restoration in Eden Robinson’s *Monkey Beach.*” *Journal of Commonwealth Literature,* 44.2 (2009): 15-33. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* Referring to the colonization and industrialization of the Kitamaat area, Soper-Jones discusses the ecological degradation of oolichan environments and the impact this degradation has on the ‘old ways’ of Haisla culture.
* “[Robinson] rejects the notion that a text has to be accessible to all readers and thus refuses, in Doris Sommer’s words, to “surrender cultural difference for the sake of universal meaning” (17).
* Cognitive maps, Soper-Jones argues, are dynamic models of one’s environmental understanding: landmarks, plant-life, etc.

Relevance:
* If Robinson admits to “rework[ing] stuff and ma[king] certain parts up,” how can we determine what is and is not real within the text? While some plants are explained in Westernized terms, others are not. Does this mean that those that have not been adapted for non-Haisla readers are actually Robinson’s fictional constructions? Is there a way to determine this within the text?
* Could a cognitive map of the plants be made based on Robinson’s geographical descriptions?

#### Turner, Nancy J., Douglas Deur, and Dana Lepofsky. “Plant Management Systems of British Columbia’s First Peoples.” *BC Studies,* 179 (2013): 107-133. Web. 9 Feb. 2015.

Claims:
* According to anthropologists and archaeologists, First Nations have been categorized as hunter/gatherer communities because of their reliance on their immediate surroundings.
* Turner et al. provide an overview of plant resource management strategies within British Columbian First Nations communities; for instance, practices to cultivate the continual growth of essential organisms.

Relevance:
* *Monkey Beach* perpetuates the idea of the hunter/gatherer society as both Mick and Ma-ma-oo participate in a culture of cultivation and ecological understanding of plant/animal resources.
* It would be interesting to see how Ma-ma-oo participates in her own cultural management of plants: leaving tobacco for tree spirits, etc.
